# Development Environment with Jupyter Notebook on Docker

This project sets up a development environment using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) on Docker. The container is based on `jupyter/minimal-notebook` image, and, has some useful packages (check `REQUIREMENTS`), allowing you to develop quantum programs locally and execute them inside the container.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Build the Docker container

To build the Docker image and set up the container without running it immediately, use the following command:

> MacOS users may have to use the command `docker-compose`.

```bash
docker compose up --build --no-start
```

> This command will create the container but will **not** start it automatically.

### Start and stop the container

Once the build is complete, you can start the container using:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> This command will start the container in the background, and share sessions with the host on port `8888`.

When you're done, you can stop the running container with:

```bash
docker compose stop
```

To completely remove the container (but keep the image), you can run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

> This will stop and remove the container and the associated network. All notebooks and data won't be lost because they are stored in the shared folder (`src/`).

## Usage

To use the installed environment, you can access the Jupiter Notebook server by opening the following URL in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

### VScode integration

If you are using VScode, you can install the [Jupiter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) to edit `.ipynb` files, without interacting with the web browser interface.

Then, you can change the Jupiter kernel setting `localhost:8888` as the new one. This allows you to execute the Jupiter file locally.

**!!!IMPORTANT!!!**
You might encounter issues with file paths. To resolve this problem, you need to set the file path relative to the directory containing the notebook. To do this, insert the following code as the first cell of the notebook:

```python
%cd ~/{path to the notebook directory as seen from vscode}
```

es. for first lab:

```python
%cd ~/src/laboratori/00
```


## Personal directory

If you wish use some notebooks please create a directory named `personal` inside `src/`.
This folder will be automatically shared with the container and will not be tracked by git.

## Data directory

To share data between the host and the container, you can use the `data` directory. This directory will be automatically shared with the container.
File related to the different lab can be found in the `data/laboratori/{lab_id}` (as example `data/laboratori/0102/` for the labs 0102) directory.

> Files related to personal files can be found in the `data/personal` directory which will not be tracked by git.
